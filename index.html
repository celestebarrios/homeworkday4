    <p3 class="summary">
        <ul>
            <li>Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.</li>
            <li>The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12</li>
            <li>A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book.</li>
            <li>He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."</li>
            <li>His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".[</li>
            <li>Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".</li>
            <li>In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH).</li>
            <li>He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,[27] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.</li>
            <li>On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.</li>
            <li>While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.</li>
        </ul>
